    When we make a method call,
    Java first checks the method name,
    Then, it compares the data types of the values given as arguments
    with the data types of the variables defined as parameters
    and if they match, it runs the method
    If the arguments and parameters do not match, it gives a CTE
    In Java, you cannot have multiple methods with the same data type and number of parameters
    If there are parameters with different data types,
    when the order is changed,
    java considers it a different method
